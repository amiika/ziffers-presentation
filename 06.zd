> Ziffers


# Basic notation

* Contains building blocks for pitches and rhythm
  * Pitches are defined as integers
    * Can be parsed from various datatypes
  * Durations as decimals or lower-case characters
  * Rest defined using **r** (or **0** in degree based notation)

# Example ziffers

zplay "0 r 4"                   # Basic ziffers
zplay 5                         # Integer
zplay [4,3]                     # Array
zplay (1..3).collect {|n| n+1}  # Enumerable
